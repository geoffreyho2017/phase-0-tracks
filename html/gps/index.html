  <h1>Liu Xiaobo is the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate to die in chains since Nazi era</h1>
  <p>China has earned a terrible place in history through its actions. Nazi Germany was the last regime to hold a Nobel Peace Prize laureate in custody until death, the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, who died of maltreatment in 1938.</p>

<h1>Liu Xiaobo, one of Chinaâ€™s most famous pro-democracy advocates and political prisoners, just died in Chinese custody at a hospital. He was 61.</h1>
<p>In 2010, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. The Chinese Communist Party refused to release Liu from prison to attend the ceremony in Norway and prevented his family from accepting the award on his behalf. So the award was presented to an empty chair.</p>

<p>Carl Von Ossietzky was a German jounalist. He ran afoul of the Nazi authorities, and was sent to concentration camp. An international campaign resulted in him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1936. Broken by abuse in mind and body, Ossietzky died in a guarded hospital room in 1938.</p>
