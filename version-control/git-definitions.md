# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is repository of files. It makes changes made to the source trackable, including who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits. Branch points to the commit's data history.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is a record of changes made to the repository. Good commit messages speed up the reviewing process, help us write a good release note, and help future maintainers understand why changes were made and why a specific feature was added.
* What is a merge conflict?
Merging is integrating the other branch into a current branch and conflict happens when we have commits in our current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa..
